# Project 1

# Jeffrey's Virtual Trivia Night

## Description 
After only a few weeks in my software enginnering bootcamp I developed and deployed my very first game, a virtual trivia game. This game was created for you to test your knowledge amongst your friends and family. There are a total of 25 questions stemming from a variety of topics including but not limited to: astronomy, music, entertainment, sports, geography, technology, and more. I have implemented responsive design so whether you'd like to play on your desktop, tablet, or mobile device, do so with ease :).
